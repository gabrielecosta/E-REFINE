# E-REFINE

This repository contains the implementation of the **Concept Drift Stream Generator (CDSG)** from the **REFINE framework**, available in the [`refine-cdsg`](https://github.com/gabrielecosta/E-REFINE/tree/refine-cdsg) branch.

## Overview

E-REFINE is a modular framework designed to address the challenges of evaluating and understanding the reasoning of machine learning-based threat detection systems (TDSs) under concept drift, by combining realistic stream generation, derived from real-world datasets, with configurable drift characteristics and a robust, reproducible evaluation pipeline. The framework takes three inputs: a source dataset, the ML-based threat detection system to be evaluated, and a set of user-defined parameters governing the experimental setup. The overall architecture of the framework is illustrated in the figure below.

E-REFINE is composed of three main subsystems:
- **Concept Drift Stream Generator (CDSG)**, which, based on user-defined parameters, generates a dataset exhibiting induced concept drift and spatial bias while avoiding temporal experimental biases. 
- **Robust Evaluation Pipeline**, comprising an *Offline module* for training the threat detection system on static data, and an *Online module* for evaluating its performance on streaming data through fixed-size windows. In addition, the online phase incorporates a set of heterogeneous concept drift detectors within the *Concept Drift Detector module*, used to verify whether the drift induced by the CDSG is consistent with the desired properties.
- **Explainable module**, which tracks the evolution of feature importance over time and quantifies how the explanations of an online ML model deviate from a reference, revealing which features contribute the most to the observed drift.
