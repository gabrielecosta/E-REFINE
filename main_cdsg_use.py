"""
Complete example of how to use CDSG.

This main file performs:

1. Concept dataset generation
2. Recurrent sudden drift generation
3. Sudden drift generation
4. Gradual drift generation

IMPORTANT
---------
The concept dataset is generated only once.

Afterwards, the three streams are generated separately
starting from the same already-generated concept dataset.
